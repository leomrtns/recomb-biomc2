	* src/ : file "summarise.c" was changed to "main_summarise.c" and
	"test_distance.c" changed to "main_distance.c".

	* biomc2-1.6 :  compilation uses autotools (autoconf, automake), the program compiles on
  MacOSX and Windows (using Microsoft "interix" or something).  cygwin or mingw don't 
  work since the program uses GNU extensions (strcasestr, etc). 
  The Microsoft product (Windows apps for Unix) is free, maybe open-sourced (at 
  least should be, since they implement gcc right?). Never tested, though.

  * biomc2_rng.c : implement GSL random functions into the program. The function 
  "getline" had be to be reimplemented as well to work on Mac.

this list is incomplete (I don't use this format anyway). Feel free to mark your changes here.
