#NEXUS 

[ This is the tree file as input to biomc2. The tree is irrevelant, but I've always 
	tried with a NJ or other not-so-bad initial state. If more than one tree is given, 
	the program will sort one of them. If there is interest, you can change this at the file 
	chain_data.c . If the tree has branch lengths, their average will be initial state for 
	average rate (the same for all segments). Otherwise a Poisson-corrected distance is calculated 
	from the sequence and assigned initial state. The program should not be dependent on initial 
	state choice. ]
